# AgentSkills: Unified Skill & Memory Workspace

This directory is the single, shared source of truth for all AI agents (Claude, Codex, Copilot, Antigravity, etc.) interacting with this repository.

## How It Works

1. **Task Initialization**:
   - The agent starts with [AgentSkills/OPERATING.md](OPERATING.md), the shared operating contract for all coding agents and AI-enabled IDEs.
   - The agent reads [AgentSkills/memory/index.md](memory/index.md) to identify relevant domains, then loads only the matching domain file(s) from `memory/lessons/`.
   - The agent reads [AgentSkills/skills/INDEX.md](skills/INDEX.md) to load `core` and any task-specific skills.

2. **Core Checklist**:
   - Before finishing any task, the agent runs the prerequisite and pre-submit checklists in [AgentSkills/skills/core/SKILL.md](skills/core/SKILL.md).

3. **Memory Update**:
   - If the agent makes a mistake or discovers a project-specific rule, it reads [memory/schema.md](memory/schema.md) for the one-line format, appends to the correct domain file, and increments the count in `index.md`.

4. **Tool Entry Points**:
   - Codex reads `AGENTS.md`.
   - Claude reads `CLAUDE.md`.
   - GitHub Copilot reads `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
   - Other coding IDEs and agents read their configured lightweight entry point.
   - Tool-specific files point back to `AgentSkills/OPERATING.md`; skill, agent, memory, checklist, and project-rule content is not duplicated.

5. **Integration Hooks**:
   - A post-tool-use hook is configured in `.github/hooks/build_test_lint.json` to run the shared harness sensor at `tools/Harness/validate.ps1`.
